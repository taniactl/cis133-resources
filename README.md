# cis133-resources

This was a resource recommened to me. It is a book. https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3CYL12KH63AVG&keywords=html+and+css+design+and+build+websites&qid=1644531111&sprefix=html%2Caps%2C98&sr=8-3

This is a good resource in my opinion because it gives excerises after each chapter and you are able to see your output.
